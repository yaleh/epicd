## <img src="./.github/5-minute-tour-256.png" alt="Getting started" width="28" height="28" align="center"> Getting started

```bash
# Install
bun i -g backlog.md
# or: npm i -g backlog.md
# or: brew install backlog-md

# Initialize in any git repo
backlog init "My Awesome Project"
```

The init wizard will ask how you want to connect AI tools:
- **MCP connector** (recommended) — auto-configures Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Kiro or Cursor and adds workflow instructions for your agents.
- **CLI commands** — creates instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, etc.) so agents use Backlog via CLI.
- **Skip** — no AI setup; use Backlog.md purely as a task manager.

All data is saved under the `backlog` folder as human-readable Markdown files (e.g. `task-10 - Add core search functionality.md`).

---

### Working with AI agents

This is the recommended flow for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Kiro and similar tools — following the **spec‑driven AI development** approach.
After running `backlog init` and choosing the MCP or CLI integration, work in this loop:

**Step 1 — Describe your idea.** Tell the agent what you want to build and ask it to split the work into small tasks with clear descriptions and acceptance criteria.

**🤖 Ask your AI Agent:**
> I want to add a search feature to the web view that searches tasks, docs, and decisions. Please decompose this into small Backlog.md tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> **Review checkpoint #1** — read the task descriptions and acceptance criteria.

**Step 2 — One task at a time.** Work on a single task per agent session, one PR per task. Good task splitting means each session can work independently without conflicts. Make sure each task is small enough to complete in a single conversation. You want to avoid running out of context window.

**Step 3 — Plan before coding.** Ask the agent to research and write an implementation plan in the task. Do this right before implementation so the plan reflects the current state of the codebase.

**🤖 Ask your AI Agent:**
> Work on BACK-10 only. Research the codebase and write an implementation plan in the task. Wait for my approval before coding.

> [!NOTE]
> **Review checkpoint #2** — read the plan. Does the approach make sense? Approve it or ask the agent to revise.

**Step 4 — Implement and verify.** Let the agent implement the task.

> [!NOTE]
> **Review checkpoint #3** — review the code, run tests, check linting, and verify the results match your expectations.

If the output is not good enough: clear the plan/notes/final summary, refine the task description and acceptance criteria, and run the task again in a fresh session.

### Working without AI agents

Use Backlog.md as a standalone task manager from the terminal or browser.

```bash
# Create and refine tasks
backlog task create "Render markdown as kanban"
backlog task edit BACK-1 -d "Detailed context" --ac "Clear acceptance criteria"

# Track work
backlog task list -s "To Do"
backlog search "kanban"
backlog board

# Work visually in the browser
backlog browser
```

You can switch between AI-assisted and manual workflows at any time — both operate on the same Markdown task files. It is recommended to modify tasks via Backlog.md commands (CLI/MCP/Web) rather than editing task files manually, so field types and metadata stay consistent.

## <img src="./.github/web-interface-256.png" alt="Web Interface" width="28" height="28" align="center"> Web Interface

Launch a modern, responsive web interface for visual task management:

```bash
# Start the web server (opens browser automatically)
backlog browser

# Custom port
backlog browser --port 8080

# Don't open browser automatically
backlog browser --no-open
```

**Features:**
- Interactive Kanban board with drag-and-drop
- Task creation and editing with rich forms
- Interactive acceptance criteria editor with checklists
- Real-time updates across all views
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Task archiving with confirmation dialogs
- Seamless CLI integration - all changes sync with markdown files

## 🔧 MCP Integration (Model Context Protocol)

The easiest way to connect Backlog.md to AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI and Kiro is via the MCP protocol.
You can run `backlog init` (even if you already initialized Backlog.md) to set up MCP integration automatically, or follow the manual steps below.

### Client guides

<details>
  <summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

  ```bash
  claude mcp add backlog --scope user -- backlog mcp start
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Codex</strong></summary>

  ```bash
  codex mcp add backlog backlog mcp start
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Gemini CLI</strong></summary>

  ```bash
  gemini mcp add backlog -s user backlog mcp start
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Kiro</strong></summary>

  ```bash
  kiro-cli mcp add --scope global --name backlog --command backlog --args mcp,start
  ```

</details>

Use the shared `backlog` server name everywhere – the MCP server auto-detects whether the current directory is initialized and falls back to `backlog://init-required` when needed.

### Manual config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "backlog": {
      "command": "backlog",
      "args": ["mcp", "start"],
      "env": {
        "BACKLOG_CWD": "/absolute/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If your IDE can't set the process working directory for MCP servers, set `BACKLOG_CWD` as shown above.
If your IDE supports custom args but not env vars, you can also use `["mcp", "start", "--cwd", "/absolute/path/to/your/project"]`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When adding the MCP server manually, you should add some extra instructions in your CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md files to inform the agent about Backlog.md.
> This step is not required when using `backlog init` as it adds these instructions automatically.
> Backlog.md's instructions for agents are available at [`/src/guidelines/mcp/agent-nudge.md`](/src/guidelines/mcp/agent-nudge.md).


Once connected, agents can read the Backlog.md workflow instructions via the resource `backlog://docs/task-workflow`.
Use `/mcp` command in your AI tool (Claude Code, Codex, Kiro) to verify if the connection is working.

## <img src="./.github/configuration-256.png" alt="Configuration" width="28" height="28" align="center"> Configuration

Backlog.md merges the following layers (highest → lowest):

1. CLI flags
2. `backlog/config.yml` (per‑project)
3. `~/backlog/user` (per‑user)
4. Built‑ins

### Interactive wizard (`backlog config`)

Run `backlog config` with no arguments to launch the full interactive wizard. This is the same experience triggered from `backlog init` when you opt into advanced settings, and it walks through the complete configuration surface:
- Cross-branch accuracy: `checkActiveBranches`, `remoteOperations`, and `activeBranchDays`.
- Git workflow: `autoCommit` and `bypassGitHooks`.
- ID formatting: enable or size `zeroPaddedIds`.
- Editor integration: pick a `defaultEditor` with availability checks.
- Definition of Done defaults: interactively add/remove/reorder/clear project-level `definition_of_done` checklist items.
- Web UI defaults: choose `defaultPort` and whether `autoOpenBrowser` should run.

Skipping the wizard (answering "No" during init) applies the safe defaults that ship with Backlog.md:
- `checkActiveBranches=true`, `remoteOperations=true`, `activeBranchDays=30`.
- `autoCommit=false`, `bypassGitHooks=false`.
- `zeroPaddedIds` disabled.
- `defaultEditor` unset (falls back to your environment).
- `defaultPort=6420`, `autoOpenBrowser=true`.

Whenever you revisit `backlog init` or rerun `backlog config`, the wizard pre-populates prompts with your current values so you can adjust only what changed.

### Definition of Done defaults

Set project-wide DoD items with `backlog config` (or during `backlog init` advanced setup), in the Web UI (Settings → Definition of Done Defaults), or by editing `backlog/config.yml` directly:

```yaml
definition_of_done:
  - Tests pass
  - Documentation updated
  - No regressions introduced
```

These items are added to every new task by default. You can add more on create with `--dod`, or disable defaults per task with `--no-dod-defaults`.
