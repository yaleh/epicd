- Installation instructions for each shell
- Usage examples showing tab completion in action
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Manual installation steps if automatic install fails

Tests should verify:
- Completion scripts generate correct suggestions
- Dynamic completions return expected values
- Installation command works correctly

- Lists key features (command completion, dynamic task IDs, smart flags, context-aware suggestions)
- Links to detailed documentation in completions/README.md

**Unit Tests Added:**
- Created `src/completions/helper.test.ts` with 14 comprehensive tests
- All tests pass ✅
- Tests cover:
  - Empty command line parsing
  - Partial and complete command/subcommand parsing
  - Flag parsing and flag value completion
  - Quoted string handling
  - Multiple flag scenarios
  - Argument position counting
  - Cursor position edge cases

**Existing Documentation:**

- `completions/EXAMPLES.md` - Detailed examples and usage scenarios
- Both created by sub-agents during shell script implementation

**Testing:**
- Unit tests: 14/14 passing
- Manual completion tests verified with `backlog completion __complete`
- All shell scripts (bash, zsh, fish) tested and working
