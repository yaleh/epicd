## Description

Follow-up to GitHub issue #313. Local install then `npx backlog` fails because npm prunes platform-specific optional dependencies that also declare a `bin` named `backlog`, and deletes `node_modules/.bin/backlog` in the process. The root package’s bin wrapper should own the CLI symlink; platform binary packages should not declare their own `bin`.

Goal: Ensure local installs create a stable `node_modules/.bin/backlog` that remains after optional dependency pruning, and the wrapper resolves the correct platform binary.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Local install: `npm i -D backlog.md` produces `./node_modules/.bin/backlog`; `npx backlog --help` works.
- [ ] #2 Platform-specific packages (backlog.md-*-*) do not declare a `bin`; only contain the binary in `files`.
- [ ] #3 Root package `bin` points to the Node wrapper (cli/index.js or scripts/cli.cjs); wrapper continues to resolve correct binary via scripts/resolveBinary.cjs.
- [ ] #4 Global install continues to work; `backlog` resolves and runs.
- [ ] #5 Add an automated install sanity check in CI (optional): npm pack + fresh install, assert .bin/backlog exists and runs `--help`.
