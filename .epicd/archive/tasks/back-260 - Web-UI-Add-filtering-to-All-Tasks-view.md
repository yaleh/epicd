## Description

Add filter controls to the All Tasks page to quickly narrow the list by common fields (status, priority, text). Provide instant updates, a way to clear filters, and persist state in the URL so filters survive navigation/reload.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Status filter lists statuses from backlog/config.yml and filters tasks
- [ ] #2 Priority filter lists high, medium, low and filters tasks
- [ ] #3 Text search filters by title and description
- [ ] #4 Filters combine with AND semantics and update the list instantly
- [ ] #5 Clear all filters resets to showing all tasks
- [ ] #6 Filter state persists in URL query parameters and restores on reload
- [ ] #7 Type-check and lint pass; filtering logic has tests
<!-- AC:END -->
