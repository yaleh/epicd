## Description

Enhance `backlog init` with interactive prompts:

- Ask for a default **reporter** name for new tasks.
- Prompt whether to store this configuration globally or only for the current repository.
- When storing locally, create a hidden `.user` settings file and make sure it is ignored by Git.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Running `backlog init` asks for a default reporter name.
- [x] User can choose between storing the reporter setting globally or locally.
- [x] Choosing the local option creates a `.user` settings file and appends it to `.gitignore`.
- [x] Reporter name saved based on the chosen scope.
