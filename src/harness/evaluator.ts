/**
 * Epic evaluation harness (BACK-628.4): the compound-phase counterpart to
 * harness/decomposer.ts. Two data-derived steps, both keyed off `parent_id`/`phase`
 * (never a status string — BACK-622's desync class):
 *
 *  1. `advanceAwaitingChildrenToAdjudicating` — an epic sitting in `awaiting-children`
 *     (actor: none, so `Interpreter.scan` never surfaces it) whose children are ALL
 *     terminal (`done` or `needs-human`) is advanced to `adjudicating` (actor: machine),
 *     replacing scan-loop.cjs's legacy `scanEvalDueEpics` status-string predicate.
 *     BACK-686.2 (Phase D, AC#5): this used to target `evaluating`; the epic path is
 *     now `awaiting-children -> adjudicating(gate) -> done/needs-human` — there is no
 *     independent `evaluating` phase left in the runtime path (evaluating still exists
 *     as a declared pipeline state, kind:script, reachable only via the manual
 *     `engine evaluate` CLI debug command). Once in `adjudicating`, the epic is picked
 *     up by the SAME generic `Interpreter.scan` machinery `decomposing`/`ready` already
 *     use, and `Driver.tick`'s adjudicating branch calls `gateAdjudicating`, whose epic
 *     path folds this module's IA+aggregation logic in directly (`adjudicate-gate.ts`).
 *  2. `evaluateEpic` — the epic-eval-due dispatch handler. BACK-657.3 (ADR-019 gap fix):
 *     this used to ONLY aggregate children's terminal phases, never running the epic's
 *     own `## Integration Acceptance` — an epic could reach `done` with its own
 *     end-to-end acceptance never having run ("all children green but the assembled
 *     system doesn't actually work", the exact failure ADR-019 exists to prevent). Now
 *     it first extracts and spawns (via `runShellCommands`, `Bun.spawn` under the hood)
 *     every shell command in the epic Description's `## Integration Acceptance` fenced
 *     code blocks; only if ALL exit 0 does it proceed to aggregate children terminal
 *     states as before (any child needs-human → epic needs-human; all done → epic
 *     done). Any failing Integration Acceptance command routes the epic straight to
 *     `needs-human`, independent of children. An epic with no Integration Acceptance
 *     section declared has nothing to gate on and falls back to children-only
 *     aggregation, unchanged from before.
